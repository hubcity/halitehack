# halitehack

Kaggle has released a new version of [Halite by Two Sigma](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite)

This project makes some simple improvements to their initial UI and adds a logging action.  More infomation can be found in my [HaliteHack notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/hubcity/halitehack-ui-improvements)

It is my hope that this quickly becomes obsolete as kaggle releases updates to halite.
